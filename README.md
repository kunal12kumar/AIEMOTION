To address the problem statement of adding emotion to AI-generated voiceovers, we can break down the solution into several key components: emotion detection, emotion synthesis in speech, and an interactive user interface. Here’s a comprehensive solution to this problem statement:
<br>
1. Emotion Detection<br>

Develop a model that can accurately detect emotions from text input. This involves:<br>

• Text Preprocessing: Tokenize the text, remove stop words, and perform lemmatization.<br>
(We can use bert tokenizer)<br>

• Sentiment Analysis: Use an NLP model to analyze the sentiment of the input text. Pretrained models like BERT or custom-trained models on emotion-labeled datasets can be
used. Datasets- EmotionLines, DailyDialog, GoEmotions.<br>

• Emotion Classification: Extend sentiment analysis to classify text into specific emotions
such as happiness, exclamation, anger, sadness, and politeness.<br>

2. Emotion Synthesis in Speech

Enhance a text-to-speech (TTS) model to incorporate emotional cues. This involves:<br>

• Selecting a TTS Engine: Choosing a robust TTS engine like Tacotron 2 or WaveNet, which can be fine-tuned.<br>

• Emotion Embeddings: Incorporate emotion embeddings into the TTS model. These embeddings will modify the prosody, pitch, and tone of the synthesized speech to reflect the detected emotion.
<br>

• Training: Train the model on a dataset that includes emotional speech samples. Datasets like the CREMA-D or EMOVO can be used for this purpose. Preprocessing audio data to extract features like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), pitch, energy, and spectrograms is an important step in preparing the data for machine learning model.<br>
<br>

3. Interactive User Interface
Develop a user-friendly interface for users to input text and receive emotionally expressive audio output.
<br>
 This involves:<br>
 <br>
• Frontend Development: Create a web-based interface using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. Frameworks like React can enhance interactivity.<br>
<br>
• Backend Development: Develop a backend using Python (Flask or Django) to handle
text input, emotion detection, and TTS processing. Libraries/Tools: Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) frameworks like spacy, NLTK, or transformers from Hugging Face.<br>
<br>
• Real-Time Processing: Ensure the system can process inputs and generate outputs in
real-time. This can be achieved through efficient model inference and API optimization.<br>
<br>
Summary
<br>
1.Collect Data: Use datasets like RAVDESS.
<br>
2. Preprocess Data: Extract features like MFCCs.<br>
3. Develop Models:<br>
   - Emotion classification: RNN or transformer.<br>
   - Audio synthesis: WaveNet or Tacotron.<br>
4. Train Models: Train using labeled data.<br>
5. Inference Pipeline: Predict emotion and generate audio.<br>
6. Evaluate Models: Use accuracy and MOS.<br>
7. Deploy: As a web service or app.<br>
